# CAGS
clean arch GOTH stack with mysql 

This is a proof of concept to work with various aspects of Fiber and HTMX

## project setup:

since the project is dependent on a data store we'll start by setting up a MySQL docker container and then use the "mysql" recipe from the Fiber examples

1. go mod init cags
2. touch main.go
3. create main.go
